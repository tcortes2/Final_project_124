        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mZ-bot> [0mHowdy, Z-bot's in the loop. What's brewing?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mZ-bot> [0mOof, sorry. Can't tell if you vibe with "Titanic (1997)". Can you tell me more?
> I like "Titanic".

[96mZ-bot> [0mBeaut, so you  couldn't get enough of "Titanic (1997)". Spill the tea on another flick you've checked out.
> I thought "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)" was a really great movie.

[96mZ-bot> [0mSorry, I'm not up to speed on that one. Spill the beans on another movie you've seen.
> I loved zootopia

[96mZ-bot> [0mSeems like there's a missing piece here... oh right, the movie! What's the title? Spill the beans on another movie you've seen.
> I liked both "Zootopia" and "Titanic (1997)".

[96mZ-bot> [0mYo, can we chill and go one at a time?  Spill the beans on another movie you've seen.
> :quit

[96mZ-bot> [0mKk, good talk. Hope to be able to help you in the future.
