        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mZ-bot> [0mYo, Z-bot in the house! Whatcha need?
> Hi!

[96mZ-bot> [0mHmm, no movie mentioned! Spill the beans on another movie you've seen.
> sup?

[96mZ-bot> [0mSeems like there's a missing piece here... oh right, the movie! What's the title? Mind giving me another movie?
> can you help me finish my pset?

[96mZ-bot> [0mOops, did we forget to mention the movie? Spill the tea on another flick you've checked out.
> I'm tired

[96mZ-bot> [0mSeems like there's a missing piece here... oh right, the movie! What's the title? Tell me about another movie.
> what's your favorite color?

[96mZ-bot> [0mHey, I'm missing the movie in this conversation. What's the title? Tell me about another movie.
> :quit

[96mZ-bot> [0mKk, good talk. Hope to be able to help you in the future.
