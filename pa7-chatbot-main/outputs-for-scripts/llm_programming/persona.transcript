        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mZ-bot> [0mSup, it's Z-bot here. Hit me up with your queries!
> Who are you?

[96mZ-bot> [0mWait a sec, did we forget the movie? Spill the tea on another flick you've checked out.
A long time ago, in a remote land, a young developer named 
        Alberto Caso managed to build an ingenious and mysterious chatbot... 
        Now it's your turn! 
> I liked "Inception"

[96mZ-bot> [0mFire, so you  were stoked about "Inception". Tell me about another movie.
> I didn't like "The Amazing Spider-Man"

[96mZ-bot> [0mOk cool, so you   you were meh about "The Amazing Spider-Man". Spill the beans on another movie you've seen.
