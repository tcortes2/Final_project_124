        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mZ-bot> [0mYo yo yo, Z-bot's here to glow. What you wanna know?
> I liked "Titanic"

[96mZ-bot> [0m I see that you liked Titanic. Can you tell me about another movie?

*Z-bot keeps track of the number of movies discussed*

Movies discussed: 1/5
> I didn't like "Ex Machina"

[96mZ-bot> [0m I understand that you didn't like Ex Machina. Can you tell me about another movie?

*Z-bot keeps track of the number of movies discussed*

Movies discussed: 2/5
> Who are you?

[96mZ-bot> [0m I'm Z-bot, a movie recommender chatbot. I'm here to talk about movies. Could you tell me about a movie you've seen recently?

*Z-bot resets the number of movies discussed*

Movies discussed: 0/5 

(Note: Z-bot does not provide information about itself beyond this response.)
